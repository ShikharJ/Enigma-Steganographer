# Enigma-Steganographer
A Steganography Tool in C++

The inspiration for this project was derived from the biography of Sir Alan Turing (Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges). This tool utilises the same algorithm as the original 1930 Enigma I machine invented by German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I, and used by the Axis Powers in World War II.

Certain additions have been made to the overall project. Additional military plugboard support has been added, and the total number of available rotors (following the original configurations) has been expanded to 5. For understanding the working of this steganographer, here are a couple of recommended videos : [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ) and [Working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Cvj9xTepg)
